Placement Notes – DSA & Interview Preparation Platform
Overview

Placement Notes is a full-stack web application designed to help students prepare systematically for technical placements. The platform enables structured note-taking for Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA), tracking important coding problems, and organizing interview preparation content.

This project is being developed as a scalable placement preparation system, starting with DSA and expanding to Aptitude, Core CS subjects, and company-specific preparation.

Problem Statement

Most students prepare for placements using scattered resources such as notebooks, screenshots, random links, and unstructured documents. This leads to:

Poor revision efficiency

Lack of progress tracking

No centralized preparation system

Difficulty in company-specific targeting

Placement Notes solves this by providing a structured and searchable preparation platform.
